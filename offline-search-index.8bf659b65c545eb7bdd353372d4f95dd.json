Thus, the target application(s) (i.e. programs) will not be able to run on the host development system.\nThe communication channel between the host and target lets the host software (e.g. XploR Studio) program and control the target hardware behavior and program code.\nBecause of the inherent architural differences between the hosts and targets, XploR Studio is integrated with different embedded compiler toolchains, operating systems, hardware designs, and debug \u0026 monitoring tools, packaged as blueprints and delivered by the IDE to provide a unified experience to create, build, deploy, test and debug designs for developers.\nmainframe Cross-platform development state \"Host Development System\" as hosts note left of hosts : where XploR IDE runs hosts : Linux or Windows on x86 / ia64 state \"Target Execution Platforms\" as targets targets : ARM, RISC-V, or others ISA(s)\\nrunning baremetal or with an\\nembedded OS note right of targets : where target applications run targets -u-\u003e hosts note left on link acknowledgement to host from target end note hosts --\u003e targets note left on link host commands to program or debug target end note Embedded Target In the post-silicon development flow, the embedded target consists of a CPU and associated peripherals (e.g. USB, Ethernet, I2C, …). The CPU implements and execute code defined by an Instruction Set Architecture (ISA, e.g. x86, ARM, RISC-V). JTAG is commonly the communication channel between the host and target for programming and debugging, as shown below:\nmainframe Post-silicon embedded target state \"Host Development System\" as hosts hosts : Linux or Windows on x86 / ia64 state \"Target Platform (ASICs)\" as targets { state CPU : x86 or ARM state Memory : DDR, SRAM, ... state Peripherals : USB, Ethernet, ... } note bottom of targets : CPU, Memory and Peripherals are\\nASIC blocks, not modifable. state JTAG note top of JTAG : JTAG used to program target memory\\nand control / debug programs on CPU. hosts -\u003e JTAG JTAG -\u003e targets Host software Some of the most common software components that run on the host computer.\nIDE XploR Studio has a command line interface as well as a graphical user interface based on the Eclipse IDE. Both are collection of software programs and tools let the developer create programs for the embedded targets.\nThe Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a unified graphical user interface that makes it easy and convenient for developers to write and debug code. The IDE typically includes a source code editor, a source-level debugger, and a build automation tool.\nThe XploR Studio IDE is a flexible and highly configurable software environment that is fully integrated with blueprints to accelerate pre and post silicon software development.\nAlso see Why do I need an IDE?\nCross toolchain The cross toolchain is the set of tools that compiles program source code, written in C/C++ or assembly language, into executable instructions that run on the target platforms. The cross toolchain consists of compilers, linker, and associated run-time libraries.\nCompiler choices: The GNU compiler (www.gnu.org), and LLVM are two most popular compilers for cross platform development. GNU GCC is compatible with a wider range of existing open source software, CPU architecture, and operating systems.\nLLVM is a more modern compiler that, while continuously evolving, provides faster compilation speed, better diagnostic, and is modularly designed, making it the popular choice for new and emerging ISA and architecture.\nGDB GDB is a GNU project command line debugger that allows developers to debug programs written in various languages. It supports many debugging formats and offers many debugging features, including the ability to step through code, set breakpoints, and examine variables. The XploR Studio IDE provides a graphical interface to GDB, making it easier to view different aspects of the running program (e.g. call-stack, variables, registers, and assembly code) from centralized dash-board.\nTarget software Bootloader Program code and data of an embedded operating system must be loaded into the target platform working memory during the device start-up. This task is achieved by the bootloader, which is a program launched immediately after the target starts.\nNote: The U-Boot bootloader is a popular bootloader available for embedded microarchitecture such as PowerPC and ARM. Recent ISA such as RISC-V takes a more minimalistic approach, such as that supported by BBL (Berkeley Boot Loader) Real-time OS (RTOS) A real-time operating system (RTOS) is an operating system that is designed to provide predictable processing time for critical tasks. An RTOS can respond to an event in a specified time period. This makes it ideal for applications that require high reliability or timing precision.\nRTOS(es) provide real-time task scheduling and basic memory management, along with advanced features such as multi-threading, interrupt handling and power management. Some RTOS(es) such as Zephyr OS are scalable and can be configured to support as many or as few features as needed in order to minimize resource and memory footprint.\nRTOS awareness: The XploR Studio IDE and related blueprints provide support for building and debugging of several popular RTOS(es) including Amazon FreeRTOS, Zephyr OS, and embedded Linux.\n","categories":"","description":"Software develoment for embedded systems","excerpt":"Software develoment for embedded systems","ref":"/docs/concepts/cross-platform/","tags":"","title":"Embedded development"},{"body":"With the advent of open source CPU implementation (e.g. openRISC ), and open ISA (e.g. RISC-V), opportunities exist for developers to innovate on both side of the coin: in both hardware and software (i.e. software-hardware co-design and development)\nTo properly supports software-hardware co-design for pre-silicon development, the embedded target must be able to host different hardware designs consisting of different ISA implementation (and sometimes more than one), HW IP(s) and peripherals, and on-chip topology.\nTarget execution platform(s) are platform devices with circuits that can be manipulated with hardware description language (HDL) to perform specific functions, including those of a microprocessor or a complete system on chip (SoC).\nExamples: FPGA(s) are common target execution platforms used for prototyping and deployment. Emulators and arguably cycle-approximate instruction set simulators, used for verification and early software development, are other examples. In the context of pre-silicon development, programming means:\nThe manipulation of the device circuits with specific HDL (hardware programming, or flashing), or The loading and debugging of executable code and data (software programming, or loading) into the memory of the microprocessor that is executing on the target execution platform. XploR Studio supports both mode of programming support both pre and post silicon software development.\nVirtual JTAG: Many XploR blueprints for execution platforms include builtin virtual JTAG supporting hardware and software programming, thus obviating the needs for costly and less convenient external JTAG device from third-parties.\nmainframe Target execution platform as the embedded target state \"Host Development System\" as hosts hosts : Linux or Windows on x86 / ia64 state \"Pre-silicon target execution platform\" as targets { state JTAG state \"HDL programmable device\" as HAPS { state CPU : x86 or ARM state Memory : DDR, SRAM, ... state Peripherals : USB, Ethernet, ... } JTAG --\u003e HAPS } note bottom of HAPS : CPU, Memory and Peripherals\\nare (or can be) programmed with HDL. state JTAG note top of JTAG : JTAG used for both hardware\\nand software programming hosts -\u003e JTAG ","categories":"","description":"Target platforms for pre-silicon development","excerpt":"Target platforms for pre-silicon development","ref":"/docs/concepts/execution-environment/","tags":"","title":"Execution platforms"},{"body":"Blueprints are packages of hardware and/or software IP(s) that are bounded to specific execution platform(s).\nIP(s) versus blueprints\" The HDL implementations of hardware peripherals, accelerator, or ISA such as ARM or RISC-V are IP(s). Blueprints are combination these IP(s) that has been customized, configured, and built to execute on specific target execution platforms, such as FPGA(s) from AMD or Intel. Blueprints are fully integrated with XploR Studio, and can be installed and used by themselves or in combination with other blueprints.\nBenefits:\nBlueprints provide clear and concise purposes - Blueprints serve as a detailed plan or a design that outlines the necessary steps and materials required to construct or create a design.\nBlueprints act as reference model - Blueprints prototype the functional behavior of the design, and can be used as a reference or golden model to help to ensure that the finished product is consistent with the original design and meets the expectations and requirements of our customers.\nBlueprints enable early software development - Together with XploR Studio IDE, blueprints enable developers to design, test, and debug software in pre-silicon phase in order to identify and address potential issues beforehand.\nBlueprints promote reusability - In many cases, HW and SW IP(s) in blueprints are hardened and reused for in-silicon and post-silicon deployment.\n","categories":"","description":"Recipes to enable your design","excerpt":"Recipes to enable your design","ref":"/docs/concepts/blueprints/","tags":"","title":"Blueprints"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"Installing XploR Studio","excerpt":"Installing XploR Studio","ref":"/docs/getting-started/installation/","tags":"","title":"Installation"},{"body":"Host System Requirements The supported operating systems for installing the product are:\nWindows 10 Ubuntu Desktop 20.04 Minimum (Windows 10) Processor: 1 gigahertz (GHz) or faster Memory: 8 GB (64-bit) Disk space: 30GB free HD space Display: 19’ Monitor, VGA capable of 1024×768 screen resolution Internet connection: Yes Recommended (Windows 10) Processor: 2 gigahertz (GHz) or faster Memory: 16 gigabytes (GB) Disk space: 50GB free HD space Display: 22’ Monitor, VGA capable of 1920x1080 screen resolution Internet connection: Yes Minimum (Ubuntu 20.04) Processor: 2 GHz dual-core processor Memory: 8 GiB RAM (system memory) Disk space: 30 GB of hard drive space Display: 19’ Monitor, VGA capable of 1024×768 screen resolution Internet connection: Yes Recommended (Ubuntu 20.04) Processor: 2 GHz dual-core processor Memory: 16 GiB RAM (system memory) Disk space: 50 GB of hard drive space Display: 22’ Monitor, VGA capable of 1920x1080 screen resolution Internet connection: Yes ","categories":"","description":"Requirements for XploR IDE","excerpt":"Requirements for XploR IDE","ref":"/docs/getting-started/installation/system-requirements/","tags":"","title":"System requirements"},{"body":"There are two ways to install the IDE:\nUsing the IDE installer.

If you are interested in embedded and FreeRTOS applications only, please skip this part.\nNetwork setup The current built-in SoC SOFs for DE2-115 support 10 Mbps (MII mode) and 1000 Mbps (RGMII mode) Ethernet network. Depending on your network setup, please use the correct SOF file when programming the DE2-115 board.\nTo debug embedded Linux RISC-V applications on the board, the following requirements are mandatory for the connection between the host PC and the DE2-115 board.\nRGMII mode:\nNetwork interface on the host PC connects to ETHERNET0 of DE2-115. The connection could be directly or via router/switches. On the board, set Jumper JP1 to pins 1 and 2. It’s default mode (RGMII mode). Default IP addresses: DE2-115 board: 192.168.1.50 TFTP server: 192.168.1.100 On the PC, the IP address is set to 192.168.1.100. If users want to use a different subnet, please update the IP of the board. To update the IP of the board, after flashing FPGA bitstream, open the /dev/ttyUSB* or COM* port console to the board and set the IP as:\nCommand Usage eth_local_ip Set the IP address of the board eth_remote_ip Set the expected IP of the TFTP Server to download kernel/rootfs for network booting netboot Start booting Linux from the network MII mode:\nNetwork interface on the host PC connects to port 0 of DE2-115. Connection speed is 10 Mpbs. On the board, set Jumper JP1 to pins 2 and 3 (to config Ethernet port 0 to run on MII mode). On the PC, the IP address is set to 192.168.1.100. The network speed and IP can be set with the following command: # Assume that the network interface is enxf8e43b5dd64a NIC=enxf8e43b5dd64a sudo ethtool -s $NIC speed 10 duplex full autoneg off # Double check ethtool $NIC # IP needs to be fixed as 192.168.1.100 # Make sure that IPv4 method is manual sudo ifconfig $NIC 192.168.1.100 TFTP server To debug embedded Linux applications, a TFTP server needs to be set up on the development PC to host Linux /images_hardware. This Linux image will be loaded when the board is flashed.\nTFTP server on Linux The quickest way to set up a TFTP server is using docker as follows:\nCreate tftpboot directory Copy boot.bin to tftpboot directory Start the TFTP server docker rm -f tftpboot cd tftpboot # Copy boot.bin (here) docker run -itd --name=tftpboot --net=host --restart=always -v ${PWD}:/var/tftpboot pghalliday/tftp SolarTFTP server on Windows 10 Prerequisites\nAdministrator permission\nSolarWinds TFTP Server: To set up a TFTP server, users will have to download the TFTP Server utility such as SolarWinds can be downloaded from https://www.solarwinds.com/free-tools/free-tftp-server. Once the .zip file is downloaded, extract it and go through the straightforward installation.\nFirewall setup: To allow remote access to the TFTP server, users need to open the firewall for TFTP service.\nStart the TFTP Server\nRun the SolarWinds TFTP Server utility by going to the Start Menu and searching for TFTP Server.\nOnce it loads up, copy the boot.bin (RISC-V Linux image) to C:\\TFTP-Root folder.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Hardware Requirements Development Board The following Intel FPGA …","ref":"/docs/hardware-environment/hardware/","tags":"","title":"Hardware and Environment Setup"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"XploR blueprints","excerpt":"XploR blueprints","ref":"/docs/blueprints/","tags":"","title":"Blueprints"},{"body":"Blueprints are packages of hardware and/or software IP(s) that extend XploR Studio with custom features and behaviors for specific execution platform(s).\nThe Blueprint Catalog is a collection of free and paid blueprints from SoC.one, community contributors, and commercial vendors.\nNote: You can peruse the Blueprint Catalog from the XploR Studio Dashboard via the Blueprints menu entry, or with xip.\nmainframe XploR blueprints state \"xplor.design - blueprint registry\" as registry { state \"Free blueprints\" state \"Paid blueprints\" } state \"Contributors\" as contributors { state \"SoC.one\" as socone state \"Open source developers\" as developers state \"Third-parties vendors\" as vendors } socone --\u003e registry : contributes developers -up-\u003e registry : contribute vendors --\u003e registry : contribute state \"XploR Studio\" as IDE state \"Target Platform\" as target IDE : User downloads and installs IDE : blueprints from XploR.design IDE : on the host system.

XploR Studio has both a command line interface (CLI) and a graphical user interface (GUI) that is currently based on the Eclipse IDE. Developers may want to use the XploR Studio GUI instead of command line for various reasons, including:\nComplete Coverage: XploR GUI offers wizards and templates for creating C/C++ standalone and embedded projects, and supports managed build, deployment, and debugging of projects in different languages such as assembly, C, and C++, and for various processor cores.\nIntegration: XploR GUI integrates with software toolchains, embedded OS(es), and reference hardware and system designs, all packaged as blueprints and made available from XploR.design.\nFast \u0026 convenient: Most users don’t want to spend much time looking at documentations (like this site). XploR GUI is an easy and convenient way to explore and experiment with different embedded designs, as well as to prototype and develop code for new platforms based on emerging ISA such as RISC-V.\nIn many cases, developers may still prefer to use XploR CLI primarily because of their familiarity of with the open source tools included with the XploR CLI tools portforlio (such as the GNU compiler toolchain or debugger). For large and complex designs, XploR CLI also makes it easy for the developers to implement scripting and automation that are more taylored toward their workflow and organization preferences.\nHow does XploR Studio help? When working with complex projects, it can be difficult to select the right ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) and implementation for your hardware design, along with compatible software toolchain, runtime environment, and debugging tools for your development needs.

Prototyping Utilize and customize software examples from XploR.design to build and prototype planned features for your design. Alternatively, build your own with available blueprints and software runtime environment to determine the degree of software readiness of the chosen core(s) and IP(s) for your solution (2). Exploration Deploy, test, and verify the functionalities of your prototype on various execution platforms (3.0). If necessary, select another platform blueprint and re-evaluate (3.1). Shift left development Accelerate software design with built-in debug and code managing capabilities of XploR Studio (4). Deploy (4.0) and migrate execution environment from simulation to FPGA(s) and emulators to align with the maturity of the hardware and SoC implementation. Verification Utilize cloud FPGA(s) or emulators for verification to ensure that your implementation of your processor core IP meets functional and performance expectations of the gold model(s) from step (2). Design exploration XploR makes it easy to utilize different processor cores and related IP(s) for your prototyping on FPGA(s) or hardware execution platforms. The ability to characterize various ingredients, be it the processor instruction set architecture (e.g. ARM ISA versus RISC-V ISA), or implementations (e.g. one RISC-V core versus another), XploR gives the designer a suitable environment to evaluate the performance and compatibility of said ingredients.\nBuilt-in integration with common tools XploR is fully integrated with many different common embedded hardware and software tools and ingredients, including:\nGNU: compiler, linker, and command line debugger LLVM: compiler and debugger FPGAs: from AMD and Intel EDA HAPS: hardware-assisted execution and prototyping systems from EDA vendors Debugging: with JTAG, and virtual JTAG Runtime: baremetal, Amazon FreeRTOS, Zephyr OS, and embedded Linux Customize your own You can customize your own design based on blueprints from XploR Design and continue to leverage the power of XploR Studio for your own software development as well as for downstream users and customers of your products.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" About XploR Studio XploR Studio is a suite of software tools and …","ref":"/about/","tags":"","title":"About XploR Studio"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/blog/","tags":"","title":"Blog"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/categories/","tags":"","title":"Categories"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/community/","tags":"","title":"Community"},{"body":" Contribution Guidelines Contributing to XploR can be a rewarding way to learn, teach, and build your hardware and softwar design skills for emerging open source initiatives such as RISC-V.\nWhy do people contribute to XploR?\nImprove software you use You can start by being users of XploR Studio and blueprints, and share your feedback and experience. If the blueprints are open-source, you may want to look at the source to see if you can patch it yourself.

We may also use cookies to collect information as you navigate our websites. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your device. The cookie may be placed by SoC.one or by an authorized third party. We use both session-based and persistent cookies on our websites. Session-based cookies exist during a single session and disappear when you close your browser or turn off your device. Persistent cookies remain on your device even after you close your browser or turn off your device.\nSoC.one categorizes the cookies on our websites into three categories: Required, Functional and Advertising cookies.\nRequired Cookies. Required cookies are necessary to enable the basic features of the website to function. SoC.one uses some cookies that are required for the delivery of services on our websites. Cookies that are required allow us to maintain and improve the safety and security of our websites, authenticate account users, allow you to access your private accounts on our websites, allow you to sign into different portions of our websites with the use of only one login, balance the traffic on our websites, and remember items in your shopping cart. Cookies that are required are not used for marketing purposes.\nFunctional Cookies. Functional cookies allow us to analyze your use of the website to evaluate and improve our performance. SoC.one also uses functional cookies to improve our service to you and personalize your web browsing experience, such as by gaining a better understanding of your interests and requirements regarding our websites, our business or our products and services. Cookies that SoC.one uses to improve our services and your website experience may remember your language and site preferences, invite you to participate in surveys or evaluations, show you when you are logged into our system and allow you to remain logged-in for a period of time, help provide you with support services, remember your login information, and prepopulate forms that you have already completed. SoC.one also uses cookies that collect information about how you use our websites, including which pages you visit, and whether you experience any errors. These cookies use aggregate information to provide statistics on how our websites are used, help us improve our websites by measuring errors, testing different designs on our websites, and helping us measure the traffic on our websites so that we can optimize our content accordingly. These cookies are used to help us improve how our websites work, understand what interests our users, and measure website quality and the effectiveness of our online advertising.\nAdvertising Cookies. Advertising cookies are used to show you ads that are more relevant to you. We may disclose this information to advertisers or use it to better understand your interests. For example, advertising cookies may be used to disclose data to advertisers so that the ads you see are more relevant to you (e.g., targeted ads). In addition, we may use remarketing technology to advertise on other websites you may visit. In doing so, a third party may place or read a unique ad-serving cookie on your device and use technical information about your browser and your activity at a SoC.one website to serve advertisements to you on non-SoC.one websites.\nIf you do not want your information to be stored by cookies, you can manage your cookie preferences by using the options and tools made available to you by either your web browser or SoC.one. You can configure your browser so that it always rejects these cookies or asks you each time whether you want to accept them or not. Your browser documentation includes instructions explaining how to enable, disable or delete cookies at the browser level (usually located within the “Help”, “Tools” or “Edit” facility). If a cookie manager has been implemented by SoC.one on the website you are visiting, the cookie tool will be displayed on the website during your visit (e.g., click the “Cookie Preferences” or similar link at the bottom of the website). You can use the cookie manager to set your cookie preference and to see a list of the cookies used on the SoC.one website. The cookie manager also provides information on the specific cookies used and the classification of the cookie (i.e., Required, Functional or Advertising). Whether you utilize the cookie manager or manage cookies at the individual browser level, please remember that Required cookies will remain and cannot be turned off. Please also understand that choosing to reject cookies may reduce the performance and functionality of our websites.\nSoC.one also uses web beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information about usage of our websites and interaction with emails from SoC.one (e.g., open rates, click through rates). Web beacons are clear electronic images that can recognize certain types of information on your device, such as cookies, when you viewed a particular website tied to the web beacon, and a description of a website tied to the web beacon. For example, SoC.one may place web beacons in marketing emails that notify SoC.one when you click on a link in the email that directs you to one of our websites.
