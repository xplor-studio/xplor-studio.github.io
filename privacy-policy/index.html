Session-based cookies exist during a single session and disappear when you close your browser or turn off your device. Persistent cookies remain on your device even after you close your browser or turn off your device.</p><p>SoC.one categorizes the cookies on our websites into three categories: Required, Functional and Advertising cookies.</p><p><strong>Required Cookies.</strong> Required cookies are necessary to enable the basic features of the website to function. SoC.one uses some cookies that are required for the delivery of services on our websites. Cookies that are required allow us to maintain and improve the safety and security of our websites, authenticate account users, allow you to access your private accounts on our websites, allow you to sign into different portions of our websites with the use of only one login, balance the traffic on our websites, and remember items in your shopping cart. Cookies that are required are not used for marketing purposes.</p><p><strong>Functional Cookies.</strong> Functional cookies allow us to analyze your use of the website to evaluate and improve our performance. SoC.one also uses functional cookies to improve our service to you and personalize your web browsing experience, such as by gaining a better understanding of your interests and requirements regarding our websites, our business or our products and services. Cookies that SoC.one uses to improve our services and your website experience may remember your language and site preferences, invite you to participate in surveys or evaluations, show you when you are logged into our system and allow you to remain logged-in for a period of time, help provide you with support services, remember your login information, and prepopulate forms that you have already completed. SoC.one also uses cookies that collect information about how you use our websites, including which pages you visit, and whether you experience any errors. These cookies use aggregate information to provide statistics on how our websites are used, help us improve our websites by measuring errors, testing different designs on our websites, and helping us measure the traffic on our websites so that we can optimize our content accordingly. These cookies are used to help us improve how our websites work, understand what interests our users, and measure website quality and the effectiveness of our online advertising.</p><p><strong>Advertising Cookies.</strong> Advertising cookies are used to show you ads that are more relevant to you. We may disclose this information to advertisers or use it to better understand your interests. For example, advertising cookies may be used to disclose data to advertisers so that the ads you see are more relevant to you (e.g., targeted ads). In addition, we may use remarketing technology to advertise on other websites you may visit. In doing so, a third party may place or read a unique ad-serving cookie on your device and use technical information about your browser and your activity at a SoC.one website to serve advertisements to you on non-SoC.one websites.</p><p>If you do not want your information to be stored by cookies, you can manage your cookie preferences by using the options and tools made available to you by either your web browser or SoC.one. You can configure your browser so that it always rejects these cookies or asks you each time whether you want to accept them or not. Your browser documentation includes instructions explaining how to enable, disable or delete cookies at the browser level (usually located within the “Help”, “Tools” or “Edit” facility). If a cookie manager has been implemented by SoC.one on the website you are visiting, the cookie tool will be displayed on the website during your visit (e.g., click the “Cookie Preferences” or similar link at the bottom of the website). You can use the cookie manager to set your cookie preference and to see a list of the cookies used on the SoC.one website. The cookie manager also provides information on the specific cookies used and the classification of the cookie (i.e., Required, Functional or Advertising). Whether you utilize the cookie manager or manage cookies at the individual browser level, please remember that Required cookies will remain and cannot be turned off. Please also understand that choosing to reject cookies may reduce the performance and functionality of our websites.</p><p>SoC.one also uses web beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information about usage of our websites and interaction with emails from SoC.one (e.g., open rates, click through rates). Web beacons are clear electronic images that can recognize certain types of information on your device, such as cookies, when you viewed a particular website tied to the web beacon, and a description of a website tied to the web beacon. For example, SoC.one may place web beacons in marketing emails that notify SoC.one when you click on a link in the email that directs you to one of our websites. SoC.one uses web beacons to operate and improve our websites and email communications.</p><h2 id=your-rights-and-choices>Your rights and choices</h2><p>In accordance with the laws of certain countries, you may have certain rights and choices regarding the personal data we collect and maintain about you, and how we communicate with you.</p><p>Where the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”), the Brazilian General Data Protection Law (“LGPD”), the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) (as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (“CPRA”)), the Personal Information Protection Law (“PIPL”) of the PRC, the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (“VCDPA”) or similar legal requirements apply to the processing of your personal data (collectively, “Data Protection Laws”), especially when you access the website from a country in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), Brazil, the PRC or as a consumer in the states of California or Virginia or in a jurisdiction with similar legal protections, you have the following rights, subject to some limitations, against the respective SoC.one Company responsible for the website you are using:</p><p>The right to request information about our use of your personal data (e.g., the pieces and categories of personal data we have; the categories of sources, purposes for collection, the third parties to whom we have disclosed personal data, and personal data we have disclosed);</p><p>The right to review and access your personal data;</p><p>The right to rectify (correct, update or modify) the personal data we hold about you;</p><p>The right to erase (e.g., delete), de-identify, anonymize or block your personal data;</p><p>The right to restrict our use of your personal data;</p><p>The right to object to our use of, or certain types of disclosures of, your personal data;</p><p>The right to request the transfer of your personal data we hold about you to a third party;</p><p>The right to receive your personal data in a usable format and transmit it to a third party (also known as the right of data portability); and</p><p>The right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority.</p><p>If you would like to exercise any of these rights, you may do so via our Personal Data Request Form.

Verification is important to protect your information and to help confirm that we are responding to a valid request and providing the response to the correct individual. To verify the request we initially ask for at least two (2) or three (3) identifiers, such as name, email address and location. If we have a need to request additional identifiers to reasonably verify your identity, we will contact you and request additional verification. The information we ask to verify your identity may depend on your relationship with us.</p><p>When you exercise your privacy rights under the applicable Data Protection Laws, you can designate an authorized agent or representative to make a request on your behalf by providing the authorized agent with written permission to do so and verifying your identity with us as part of the request, or by providing the authorized agent with Power of Attorney pursuant to applicable law (e.g., the California Probate code). We will ask the individual submitting the request to denote that they are an authorized agent or representative. When submitted by an authorized agent or representative, we ask the authorized agent or representative to provide name, email address and a description of the relationship with the individual who is the subject of the request and to certify that the representative has permission to submit the request, and may request proof of the consumer’s written permission.</p><h2 id=security>Security</h2><p>SoC.one intends to protect your personal data.
