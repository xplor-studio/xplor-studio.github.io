Thus, the target application(s) (i.e. programs) will not be able to run on the host development system.\nThe communication channel between the host and target lets the host software (e.g. XploR Studio) program and control the target hardware behavior and program code.\nBecause of the inherent architural differences between the hosts and targets, XploR Studio is integrated with different embedded compiler toolchains, operating systems, hardware designs, and debug \u0026 monitoring tools, packaged as components and delivered by the IDE to provide a unified experience to create, build, deploy, test and debug designs for developers.\nmainframe Cross-platform development state \"Host Development System\" as hosts note left of hosts : where XploR IDE runs hosts : Linux or Windows on x86 / ia64 state \"Target Execution Platforms\" as targets targets : ARM, RISC-V, or others ISA(s)\\nrunning baremetal or with an\\nembedded OS note right of targets : where target applications run targets -u-\u003e hosts note left on link acknowledgement to host from target end note hosts --\u003e targets note left on link host commands to program or debug target end note Embedded Target In the post-silicon development flow, the embedded target consists of a CPU and associated peripherals (e.g. USB, Ethernet, I2C, …). The CPU implements and execute code defined by an Instruction Set Architecture (ISA, e.g. x86, ARM, RISC-V). JTAG is commonly the communication channel between the host and target for programming and debugging, as shown below:\nmainframe Post-silicon embedded target state \"Host Development System\" as hosts hosts : Linux or Windows on x86 / ia64 state \"Target Platform (ASICs)\" as targets { state CPU : x86 or ARM state Memory : DDR, SRAM, ... state Peripherals : USB, Ethernet, ... } note bottom of targets : CPU, Memory and Peripherals are\\nASIC blocks, not modifable. state JTAG note top of JTAG : JTAG used to program target memory\\nand control / debug programs on CPU. hosts -\u003e JTAG JTAG -\u003e targets Host software Some of the most common software components that run on the host computer.\nIDE XploR Studio has a command line interface as well as a graphical user interface based on the Eclipse IDE. Both are collection of software programs and tools let the developer create programs for the embedded targets.\nThe Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a unified graphical user interface that makes it easy and convenient for developers to write and debug code. The IDE typically includes a source code editor, a source-level debugger, and a build automation tool.\nThe XploR Studio IDE is a flexible and highly configurable software environment that is fully integrated with components to accelerate pre and post silicon software development.\nAlso see Why do I need an IDE?\nCross toolchain The cross toolchain is the set of tools that compiles program source code, written in C/C++ or assembly language, into executable instructions that run on the target platforms. The cross toolchain consists of compilers, linker, and associated run-time libraries.\nCompiler choices: The GNU compiler (www.gnu.org), and LLVM are two most popular compilers for cross platform development. GNU GCC is compatible with a wider range of existing open source software, CPU architecture, and operating systems.\nLLVM is a more modern compiler that, while continuously evolving, provides faster compilation speed, better diagnostic, and is modularly designed, making it the popular choice for new and emerging ISA and architecture.\nGDB GDB is a GNU project command line debugger that allows developers to debug programs written in various languages. It supports many debugging formats and offers many debugging features, including the ability to step through code, set breakpoints, and examine variables. The XploR Studio IDE provides a graphical interface to GDB, making it easier to view different aspects of the running program (e.g. call-stack, variables, registers, and assembly code) from centralized dash-board.\nTarget software Bootloader Program code and data of an embedded operating system must be loaded into the target platform working memory during the device start-up. This task is achieved by the bootloader, which is a program launched immediately after the target starts.\nNote: The U-Boot bootloader is a popular bootloader available for embedded microarchitecture such as PowerPC and ARM. Recent ISA such as RISC-V takes a more minimalistic approach, such as that supported by BBL (Berkeley Boot Loader) Real-time OS (RTOS) A real-time operating system (RTOS) is an operating system that is designed to provide predictable processing time for critical tasks. An RTOS can respond to an event in a specified time period. This makes it ideal for applications that require high reliability or timing precision.\nRTOS(es) provide real-time task scheduling and basic memory management, along with advanced features such as multi-threading, interrupt handling and power management. Some RTOS(es) such as Zephyr OS are scalable and can be configured to support as many or as few features as needed in order to minimize resource and memory footprint.\nRTOS awareness: The XploR Studio IDE and related components provide support for building and debugging of several popular RTOS(es) including Amazon FreeRTOS, Zephyr OS, and embedded Linux.\n","categories":"","description":"Software develoment for embedded systems","excerpt":"Software develoment for embedded systems","ref":"/docs/concepts/cross-platform/","tags":"","title":"Embedded development"},{"body":"Host System Requirements The supported operating systems for installing the product are:\nWindows 10 Ubuntu Desktop 20.04 Minimum (Windows 10) Processor: 1 gigahertz (GHz) or faster Memory: 8 GB (64-bit) Disk space: 30GB free HD space Display: 19’ Monitor, VGA capable of 1024×768 screen resolution Internet connection: Yes Recommended (Windows 10) Processor: 2 gigahertz (GHz) or faster Memory: 16 gigabytes (GB) Disk space: 50GB free HD space Display: 22’ Monitor, VGA capable of 1920x1080 screen resolution Internet connection: Yes Minimum (Ubuntu 20.04) Processor: 2 GHz dual-core processor Memory: 8 GiB RAM (system memory) Disk space: 30 GB of hard drive space Display: 19’ Monitor, VGA capable of 1024×768 screen resolution Internet connection: Yes Recommended (Ubuntu 20.04) Processor: 2 GHz dual-core processor Memory: 16 GiB RAM (system memory) Disk space: 50 GB of hard drive space Display: 22’ Monitor, VGA capable of 1920x1080 screen resolution Internet connection: Yes ","categories":"","description":"Requirements for XploR IDE","excerpt":"Requirements for XploR IDE","ref":"/docs/installation/system-requirements/","tags":"","title":"System requirements"},{"body":"With the advent of open source CPU implementation (e.g. openRISC ), and open ISA (e.g. RISC-V), opportunities exist for developers to innovate on both side of the coin: in both hardware and software (i.e. software-hardware co-design and development)\nTo properly supports software-hardware co-design for pre-silicon development, the embedded target must be able to host different hardware designs consisting of different ISA implementation (and sometimes more than one), HW IP(s) and peripherals, and on-chip topology.\nTarget execution platform(s) are platform devices with circuits that can be manipulated with hardware description language (HDL) to perform specific functions, including those of a microprocessor or a complete system on chip (SoC).\nExamples: FPGA(s) are common target execution platforms used for prototyping and deployment.

The Console view is connected to stdin, stdout, and stderr of the compilation process. An example of Console view output:\nThe Console view only represents programs that are running on the host, such as compilers and linkers. Programs running on an external target will display their output in other views, such as a terminal emulator window, depending on the type of target.\nRegister View The Register view displays the contents of the CPU registers. The Register view is connected to the GDB server. An example of Register view output:\nProblems View The Problems view displays problems detected by the build tools. The Problems view is connected to the build tools. An example of Problems view output:\nExecutables View The Executables view displays the executables that are part of the current project. The Executables view is connected to the build tools. An example of Executables view output:\nTerminal View The Terminal view displays a terminal emulator window. The Terminal view is connected to the host machine. An example of Terminal view output:\nUsers can use this Terminal view to open the shell/bash console of the host machine, remote connection, or serial connection to the target platform. For example, with a serial terminal, users can specify additional parameters such as which device to connect, baud rate, and similar.\nPeripheral Registers View In the complex application where the peripherals are configured with the RISC-V cores, users can examine the peripherals’ status such as control register values, and data register values via the Peripheral Registers View. The Peripherals Registers View lists all peripherals available in the device hardware description .SVD file provided by the silicon vendor. To active Peripheral registers view, select Window \u003e Preferences.\nThen select C/C++ \u003e Debug section Click Peripheral Registers Page.

It provides a set of to ols and interface for controlling and configuring traces, which are the components reponsible for collecting trace data (system events and logs) from various sources in the system.\nTo start working with LTTng Tracer Control, please refer to LTTng Trace Control Linux Project.\nView and Analysis trace data with Linux user space and kernel trace LTTng Kernel Traces (Project Explorer View, Events Editor, Histogram View, CPU Usage View, Disk I/O Activity View, Kernel Memory Usage View, Control Flow View, Resources View, …). Kernel does not have information that can populate a flame chart view.\nLTTng-UST Traces (Events Editor, Flame Chart View, Flame Graph View, Function Duration Statistics View, Function Durations Distribution ViewProject Explorer View, …)\nEvent Editor The Events editor shows the basic trace data elements (events) in a tabular format. The header displays the current trace (or experiment) name. In this case, it is Default…/kernel\nThe columns of the table are defined by the fields (aspects) of the specific trace type (ust or kernel). These are the defaults:\nTimestamp: the event timestamp\nEvent Type: the event type\nContents: the fields (or payload) of this event\nThe highlighted event is the current event and is synchronized with the other views. If you select another event, the other views will be updated accordingly. The properties view will display a more detailed view of the selected event. For example:\nAn event range can be selected by holding the Shift key while clicking another event or using any of the cursor keys ( Up’, Down, PageUp, PageDown, Home, End). The first and last events in the selection will be used to determine the current selected time range for synchronization with the other views.\nIf the Event editor is closed, the views will display empty states. For example:\nSearching and filtering When a searching condition is applied to the header row, the table will select the next matching event starting from the top currently displayed event. All matching events will have a ‘search match’ icon in their left margin. Non-matching events will be dimmed. The characters in each column which match the regular expression will be highlighted.\nPressing the Enter key will search and select the next matching event. Pressing the Shift+Enter key will search and select the previous matching event. Press Esc to cancel an ongoing search.\nTo add the currently applied search condition(s) as filter(s), click the Add as Filter button in the header row margin, or press the Ctrl+Enter key.\nPress Delete to clear the header row and reset all events to normal.\nHistogram View The Histogram View display the trace events distribution with respect to time.\nThe Align Views toggle button in the view menu allows to disable and enable the automatic time axis alignment of time-based views. Disabling the alignment in the Histogram view will disable this feature across all the views because it’s a workspace preference.\nThe Hide Lost Events toggle button in the local toolbar allows to hide the bars of lost events. When the button is selected it can be toggled again to show the lost events.\nThe Activate Trace Coloring toggle button in the local toolbar allows to use separate colors for each trace of an experiment. Note that this feature is not available if your experiment contains more than twenty two traces. When activated, a legend is displayed at the bottom on the histogram view.\nOn the top left, there are three text controls:\nSelection Start: Displays the start time of the current selection\nSelection End: Displays the end time of the current selection\nWindow Span: Displays the current zoom window size in seconds\nThe mouse can be used to control the histogram:\nLeft-click: Set a selection time\nLeft-drag: Set a selection range\nShift-left-click or drag: Extend or shrink the selection range\nMiddle-click or Ctrl-left-click: Center the zoom window on mouse (full histogram only)\nMiddle-drag or Ctrl-left-drag: Move the zoom window\nRight-drag: Set the zoom window\nShift-right-click or drag: Extend or shrink the zoom window (full histogram only)\nMouse wheel up: Zoom in\nMouse wheel down: Zoom out\nHovering the mouse over an histogram bar pops up an information window that displays the start/end time of the corresponding bar, as well as the number of events (and lost events) it represents. If the mouse is over the selection range, the selection span in seconds is displayed.\nIn each histogram, the following keys are handled:\nLeft Arrow: Moves the current event to the previous non-empty bar\nRight Arrow: Moves the current event to the next non-empty bar\nHome: Sets the current time to the first non-empty bar\nEnd: Sets the current time to the last non-empty histogram bar\nPlus (+): Zoom in\nMinus (-): Zoom out\nStatistic View The Statistics View displays the various event counters that are collected when analyzing a trace. The statistics is collected for the whole trace.\nThe view is separated in two sides. The left side of the view presents the Statistics in a table. The table shows 3 columns: Level Events total and Events in selected time range.\nThe data is organized per trace. After parsing a trace the view will display the number of events per event type in the second column and in the third, the currently selected time range’s event type distribution is shown.\nThe cells where the number of events are printed also contain a colored bar with a number that indicates the percentage of the event count in relation to the total number of events. The right side illustrates the proportion of types of events into two pie charts. The legend of each pie chart gives the representation of each color in the chart.\nThe Global pie chart displays the general proportion of the events in the trace.\nWhen there is a range selection, the Events in selection pie chart appears next to the Global pie chart and displays the proportion the event in the selected range of the trace.\nCPU Usage View The CPU Usage analysis and view is specific to LTTng Kernel traces. The CPU usage is derived from a kernel trace as long as the sched_switch event was enabled during the collection of the trace. This analysis is executed the first time that the CPU Usage view is opened after opening the trace. To open the view, double-click on the CPU Usage tree element under the Linux Kernel Analysis tree element of the Project Explorer.\nNow, the CPU Usage view will show:\nThe view is divided into the following important sections: Process Information and the CPU Usage Chart.\nProcess Information The process Information is displayed on the left side of the view and shows all threads that were executing on all available CPUs in the current time range. For each process, it shows in different columns the thread ID (TID), process name (Process), the average (%) execution time and the actual execution time (Time) during the current time range. It shows all threads that were executing on the CPUs in the current time range.\nCPU Usage Chart The CPU Usage Chart on the right side of the view, plots the total time spent on all CPUs of all processes and the time of the selected process.\nTooltips Hover the cursor over a line of the chart and a tooltip will pop up with the following information:\nTime: current time of mouse position\ntotal: The total CPU usage\nprocess: CPU usage of selected process\nKernel Memory Usage View The Kernel Memory Usage View is specific to kernel traces. To open the view, double-click on the Kernel Memory Usage Analysis tree element under the Kernel tree element of the Project Explorer.\nNow, the Kernel memory usage view will show:\nWhere:\nTID: The ID of the thread this event belongs to\nProcess: The process of the TID that belongs to it\nControl FLow View The Control Flow view is a LTTng-specific view that shows per-process events graphically. The Linux Kernel Analysis is executed the first time when a LTTng Kernel is opened. After opening the trace, the element Control Flow is added under the Linux Kernel Analysis tree element in the Project Explorer. To open the view, double-click the Control Flow tree element.\nYou should get something like this:\nThe view is divided into the following important sections: process tree and information, control flow and the toolbar. The following sections provide detailed information for each part of the Control Flow View.\nProcess tree and information\nControl flow\nToolbar\nFlame Chart View The Flame Chart view allows the user to visualize the call stack per thread over time, if the application and trace provide this information.\nTo open this view go in Window -\u003e Show View, if in the eclipse plug-in then click Other… and select Tracing/Flame Chart in the list. The view shows the call stack information for the currently selected trace. Conversely, you can select a trace and expand it in the Project Explorer then expand LTTng-UST CallStack Analysis (the trace must be loaded) and open Flame Chart.\nFlame Chart View will show:\nThe Flame Chart View shows the state of the stack at all moments during the trace. That view shows for all threads of the application, the functions that were called, so it’s easy to see who called who and when.\nFlame Graph View This is an aggregate view of the function calls from the Flame Chart View\nEach entry in the Flame Graph represents an aggregation of all the calls to a function in a certain depth of the call stack having the same caller. So, functions in the Flame Graph are aggregated by depth and caller. This enables the user to find the most executed code path easily.\nThe function name is visible on each Flame graph event if the size permits. Each box in the Flame Graph has the same color as the box representing the same function in the Flame Chart.\nTo use the Flame graph, one can navigate it and find which function is consuming the most self-time.\nEach box represents a function in the stack (a “stack frame”).\nThe y-axis shows stack depth (number of frames on the stack). The top box shows the function that was on-CPU. Everything beneath that is ancestry. The function beneath a function is its parent, just like the stack traces shown earlier. (Some flame graph implementations prefer to invert the order and use an “icicle layout”, so flames look upside down.)\nThe x-axis spans the sample population. It does not show the passing of time from left to right, as most graphs do. The left to right ordering has no meaning (it’s sorted alphabetically to maximize frame merging).\nThe width of the box shows the total time it was on-CPU or part of an ancestry that was on-CPU (based on sample count). Functions with wide boxes may consume more CPU per execution than those with narrow boxes, or, they may simply be called more often. The call count is not shown (or known via sampling).\nFunction Duration Statistics View Function Duration Statistics View is a bar graph that shows the number of function calls with respect to their duration. The count is using a logarithmic scale. In this example it shows that very few functions takes longer than 0.5ms\nFunction Duration Distribution View The Function Duration Statistics View is a table with each function’s minimum, maximum, average duration and other statistical parameters that may show that in certain cases, the duration can be bigger or lower depending on the context.\nReferences Trace Compass User Guide.

XploR Studio has both a command line interface (CLI) and a graphical user interface (GUI) that is currently based on the Eclipse IDE. Developers may want to use the XploR Studio GUI instead of command line for various reasons, including:\nComplete Coverage: XploR GUI offers wizards and templates for creating C/C++ standalone and embedded projects, and supports managed build, deployment, and debugging of projects in different languages such as assembly, C, and C++, and for various processor cores.\nIntegration: XploR GUI integrates with software toolchains, embedded OS(es), and reference hardware and system designs, all packaged as components and made available from XploR.design.\nFast \u0026 convenient: Most users don’t want to spend much time looking at documentations (like this site). XploR GUI is an easy and convenient way to explore and experiment with different embedded designs, as well as to prototype and develop code for new platforms based on emerging ISA such as RISC-V.\nIn many cases, developers may still prefer to use XploR CLI primarily because of their familiarity of with the open source tools included with the XploR CLI tools portforlio (such as the GNU compiler toolchain or debugger). For large and complex designs, XploR CLI also makes it easy for the developers to implement scripting and automation that are more taylored toward their workflow and organization preferences.\nHow does XploR Studio help? When working with complex projects, it can be difficult to select the right ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) and implementation for your hardware design, along with compatible software toolchain, runtime environment, and debugging tools for your development needs.

Prototyping Utilize and customize software examples from XploR.design to build and prototype planned features for your design. Alternatively, build your own with available components and software runtime environment to determine the degree of software readiness of the chosen core(s) and IP(s) for your solution (2). Exploration Deploy, test, and verify the functionalities of your prototype on various execution platforms (3.0). If necessary, select another platform component and re-evaluate (3.1). Shift left development Accelerate software design with built-in debug and code managing capabilities of XploR Studio (4). Deploy (4.0) and migrate execution environment from simulation to FPGA(s) and emulators to align with the maturity of the hardware and SoC implementation. Verification Utilize cloud FPGA(s) or emulators for verification to ensure that your implementation of your processor core IP meets functional and performance expectations of the gold model(s) from step (2). Design exploration XploR makes it easy to utilize different processor cores and related IP(s) for your prototyping on FPGA(s) or hardware execution platforms. The ability to characterize various ingredients, be it the processor instruction set architecture (e.g. ARM ISA versus RISC-V ISA), or implementations (e.g. one RISC-V core versus another), XploR gives the designer a suitable environment to evaluate the performance and compatibility of said ingredients.\nBuilt-in integration with common tools XploR is fully integrated with many different common embedded hardware and software tools and ingredients, including:\nGNU: compiler, linker, and command line debugger LLVM: compiler and debugger FPGAs: from AMD and Intel EDA HAPS: hardware-assisted execution and prototyping systems from EDA vendors Debugging: with JTAG, and virtual JTAG Runtime: baremetal, Amazon FreeRTOS, Zephyr OS, and embedded Linux Customize your own You can customize your own design based on components from XploR Design and continue to leverage the power of XploR Studio for your own software development as well as for downstream users and customers of your products.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" About XploR Studio XploR Studio is a suite of software tools and …","ref":"/about/","tags":"","title":"About XploR Studio"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/blog/","tags":"","title":"Blog"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/categories/","tags":"","title":"Categories"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/community/","tags":"","title":"Community"},{"body":" Contribution Guidelines Contributing to XploR can be a rewarding way to learn, teach, and build your hardware and softwar design skills for emerging open source initiatives such as RISC-V.\nWhy do people contribute to XploR?\nImprove software you use You can start by being users of XploR Studio and components, and share your feedback and experience.

For California consumers, please see the California Supplemental Privacy Statement.\nCookies and other technology When you visit our websites we may automatically collect information such as your IP address, browsing history, information on your interaction with the website, browser type and language, operating system, location, date and time (i.e., the category above referred to as Internet or other similar network activity). We may also use cookies to collect information as you navigate our websites. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your device. The cookie may be placed by SoC.one or by an authorized third party. We use both session-based and persistent cookies on our websites. Session-based cookies exist during a single session and disappear when you close your browser or turn off your device. Persistent cookies remain on your device even after you close your browser or turn off your device.\nSoC.one categorizes the cookies on our websites into three categories: Required, Functional and Advertising cookies.\nRequired Cookies. Required cookies are necessary to enable the basic features of the website to function. SoC.one uses some cookies that are required for the delivery of services on our websites. Cookies that are required allow us to maintain and improve the safety and security of our websites, authenticate account users, allow you to access your private accounts on our websites, allow you to sign into different portions of our websites with the use of only one login, balance the traffic on our websites, and remember items in your shopping cart. Cookies that are required are not used for marketing purposes.\nFunctional Cookies. Functional cookies allow us to analyze your use of the website to evaluate and improve our performance. SoC.one also uses functional cookies to improve our service to you and personalize your web browsing experience, such as by gaining a better understanding of your interests and requirements regarding our websites, our business or our products and services. Cookies that SoC.one uses to improve our services and your website experience may remember your language and site preferences, invite you to participate in surveys or evaluations, show you when you are logged into our system and allow you to remain logged-in for a period of time, help provide you with support services, remember your login information, and prepopulate forms that you have already completed. SoC.one also uses cookies that collect information about how you use our websites, including which pages you visit, and whether you experience any errors. These cookies use aggregate information to provide statistics on how our websites are used, help us improve our websites by measuring errors, testing different designs on our websites, and helping us measure the traffic on our websites so that we can optimize our content accordingly. These cookies are used to help us improve how our websites work, understand what interests our users, and measure website quality and the effectiveness of our online advertising.\nAdvertising Cookies. Advertising cookies are used to show you ads that are more relevant to you. We may disclose this information to advertisers or use it to better understand your interests. For example, advertising cookies may be used to disclose data to advertisers so that the ads you see are more relevant to you (e.g., targeted ads). In addition, we may use remarketing technology to advertise on other websites you may visit. In doing so, a third party may place or read a unique ad-serving cookie on your device and use technical information about your browser and your activity at a SoC.one website to serve advertisements to you on non-SoC.one websites.\nIf you do not want your information to be stored by cookies, you can manage your cookie preferences by using the options and tools made available to you by either your web browser or SoC.one. You can configure your browser so that it always rejects these cookies or asks you each time whether you want to accept them or not. Your browser documentation includes instructions explaining how to enable, disable or delete cookies at the browser level (usually located within the “Help”, “Tools” or “Edit” facility). If a cookie manager has been implemented by SoC.one on the website you are visiting, the cookie tool will be displayed on the website during your visit (e.g., click the “Cookie Preferences” or similar link at the bottom of the website). You can use the cookie manager to set your cookie preference and to see a list of the cookies used on the SoC.one website. The cookie manager also provides information on the specific cookies used and the classification of the cookie (i.e., Required, Functional or Advertising). Whether you utilize the cookie manager or manage cookies at the individual browser level, please remember that Required cookies will remain and cannot be turned off. Please also understand that choosing to reject cookies may reduce the performance and functionality of our websites.\nSoC.one also uses web beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information about usage of our websites and interaction with emails from SoC.one (e.g., open rates, click through rates). Web beacons are clear electronic images that can recognize certain types of information on your device, such as cookies, when you viewed a particular website tied to the web beacon, and a description of a website tied to the web beacon. For example, SoC.one may place web beacons in marketing emails that notify SoC.one when you click on a link in the email that directs you to one of our websites. SoC.one uses web beacons to operate and improve our websites and email communications.\nYour rights and choices In accordance with the laws of certain countries, you may have certain rights and choices regarding the personal data we collect and maintain about you, and how we communicate with you.\nWhere the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”), the Brazilian General Data Protection Law (“LGPD”), the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) (as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (“CPRA”)), the Personal Information Protection Law (“PIPL”) of the PRC, the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (“VCDPA”) or similar legal requirements apply to the processing of your personal data (collectively, “Data Protection Laws”), especially when you access the website from a country in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), Brazil, the PRC or as a consumer in the states of California or Virginia or in a jurisdiction with similar legal protections, you have the following rights, subject to some limitations, against the respective SoC.one Company responsible for the website you are using:\nThe right to request information about our use of your personal data (e.g., the pieces and categories of personal data we have; the categories of sources, purposes for collection, the third parties to whom we have disclosed personal data, and personal data we have disclosed);\nThe right to review and access your personal data;\nThe right to rectify (correct, update or modify) the personal data we hold about you;\nThe right to erase (e.g., delete), de-identify, anonymize or block your personal data;\nThe right to restrict our use of your personal data;\nThe right to object to our use of, or certain types of disclosures of, your personal data;\nThe right to request the transfer of your personal data we hold about you to a third party;\nThe right to receive your personal data in a usable format and transmit it to a third party (also known as the right of data portability); and\nThe right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority.\nIf you would like to exercise any of these rights, you may do so via our Personal Data Request Form.

Verification is important to protect your information and to help confirm that we are responding to a valid request and providing the response to the correct individual. To verify the request we initially ask for at least two (2) or three (3) identifiers, such as name, email address and location. If we have a need to request additional identifiers to reasonably verify your identity, we will contact you and request additional verification. The information we ask to verify your identity may depend on your relationship with us.\nWhen you exercise your privacy rights under the applicable Data Protection Laws, you can designate an authorized agent or representative to make a request on your behalf by providing the authorized agent with written permission to do so and verifying your identity with us as part of the request, or by providing the authorized agent with Power of Attorney pursuant to applicable law (e.g., the California Probate code). We will ask the individual submitting the request to denote that they are an authorized agent or representative. When submitted by an authorized agent or representative, we ask the authorized agent or representative to provide name, email address and a description of the relationship with the individual who is the subject of the request and to certify that the representative has permission to submit the request, and may request proof of the consumer’s written permission.\nSecurity SoC.one intends to protect your personal data.
